      "Based on the information provided, a chronological timeline detailing the historical developments of coronary thrombi cannot be constructed. The available research clarifies the critical role of thrombi in coronary events but does not offer specific dates, historical progression, or developmental milestones related to their understanding or treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research highlights a direct and crucial link between \"thrombotic crises\" and the diagnosis of \"ST-elevation myocardial infarction\" (STEMI). This indicates that thrombi are fundamental in the pathology of this severe form of heart attack. More broadly, the context provided identifies \"cardiovascular disease\" as encompassing \"thrombotic disease,\" underscoring the pervasive impact of blood clot formation in the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, acute myocardial infarction, a specific type of myocardial infarction, is frequently and significantly associated with these thrombotic events. While this information establishes the profound significance of thrombi in cardiac health, it does not offer the chronological data necessary to build a timeline of their study or discovery.\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "RESEARCH LIMITATIONS\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "This research on coronary thrombi exclusively utilized data from the Medical Knowledge Graph, specifically limited to the year 2024. Consequently, it does not incorporate insights from other medical databases, clinical trials published in prior years, or a broader scope of cardiovascular topics beyond coronary thrombi. While all five search queries passed relevance filtering, the extremely narrow temporal window and small dataset of only 19 retrieved information chunks mean these findings are not comprehensive and lack historical context or broader recent developments. This summary should therefore not be considered an exhaustive overview of all available research.\n",
